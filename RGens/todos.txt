@TODO 10/11/17 Ben Culkin :GrammarReorg
	Better organize the provided sample grammars.

@TODO 10/11/17 Ben Culkin :Determinism
	Add a way to get the grammar to pick rules in a deterministic fashion,
	so as to be able to iterate all of the rules.

@TODO 10/11/17 Ben Culkin :ExportSanity
	Figure out a way to organize exports instead of just sticking them all
	into the global namespace. Maybe use the @ symbol for 'foreign rule
	references' (FRRs)

@TODO 10/23/17 Ben Culkin :Casing
	Provide some way to convert rules into different cases.

@TODO 10/23/17 Ben Culkin :Spacing
	Find a saner way to do spacing. + rules work well for some things, but
	what is needed is some way to do it only one level deep. Possibly some
	kind of pragma to convert a rule to a single-level spacer?

@TODO 10/23/17 Ben Culkin :Pluralizing
	Add some way to say to pluralize the contents of a rule

@TODO 10/23/17 Ben Culkin :Extensions
	Add some soft of pragmas to allow the loading of extensions that provide
	custom rules/case types/pragmas and things like that
