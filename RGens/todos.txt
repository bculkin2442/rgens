@TODO 10/11/17 Ben Culkin :GrammarReorg
	Better organize the provided sample grammars.

@TODO 10/11/17 Ben Culkin :Determinism
	Add a way to get the grammar to pick rules in a deterministic fashion,
	so as to be able to iterate all of the rules.

@TODO 10/11/17 Ben Culkin :ExportSanity
	Figure out a way to organize exports instead of just sticking them all
	into the global namespace. Maybe use the @ symbol for 'foreign rule
	references' (FRRs)
